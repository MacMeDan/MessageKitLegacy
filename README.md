# MessageKit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MessageKit/MessageKit-iOS.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/MessageKit/MessageKit-iOS) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/MessageKit/MessageKit-iOS/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/MessageKit/MessageKit-iOS)

*Eventually*, a Swift re-write of [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController).

**:warning: Currently, there's no code here, only empty projects! :sweat_smile:** 

**Please be patient while I get this project going. It will be slow.**

### Timeline

I don't have a solid timeline for releasing `v1.0` of this library. However, I *can* say that `v1.0` **will not** be released until **after** Swift 3.0. This is to avoid churn with major releases, and it fits with how much time I have to work on this. Also, Swift 3 isn't *that* far away. 

> There may be a beta before Swift 3, and clients are always well to use what's on `develop` at their own risk.

### Want to help?

Good! :smile: There's already interest from the community, see [#1](https://github.com/MessageKit/MessageKit/issues/1). Once I get some basics setup — the initial project, example app, travis-ci, roadmap, etc. — I will start adding contributors.

> **Please do not open any issues or PRs yet. The project is not quite ready! :smile:**
